Pretty much disregard the main.rs file. It is some ugly version in yew which I abandonned. I am using the lib.rs file for actually getting the memo for 7simul, which is currently being used through a python webapp.

Might in the future develop something with actix. Additionally, might need to give support for picking multiple orientations.
